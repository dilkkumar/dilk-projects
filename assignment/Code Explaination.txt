                                    Code Explaination:-

* The signalQuality function calculates the signal quality of a tower at a given coordinate, 
  by computing the Euclidean distance between the tower and the coordinate, and applying 
  the signal quality formula given in the problem statement. If the distance is greater than 
  the radius, the tower is not reachable and its signal quality is 0.

* The networkQuality function calculates the network quality at a given coordinate, 
  by iterating over all towers and summing up their signal qualities.

* The findBestLocation function iterates over all integral coordinates in the range [0,50] x [0,50] and finds 
  the one with maximum network quality. If there are multiple coordinates with the same network quality, 
  it returns the lexicographically minimum one.

* In the main function, we define the input towers and radius, call the findBestLocation function, and print the result.
